- 👋 Hi, I’m @fostemi
- 👀 I’ve been interested in machine learning algorithms, project design, finance projects with python, and environmental research. My new goal is to deploy applications as efficiently as possible. I want to automate all of the toil in my life! I'm currently training for an Iron Man 70.3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, golang, and cloud computing.  I am currently working on a project that will be an internal developer platform that will automate creation tickets of infrastructure for deploying applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applying different machine learning algorithms to different financial markets. I am currently working on a texas hold'em react application that interacts with data collected from users to return valuable data to the user.
